As a Microsoft Certified Azure Data Fundamentals professional, I have a strong foundational understanding of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure services. My knowledge covers relational and non-relational data, data storage options, data processing, and data analytics solutions.

I help organizations understand key Azure data services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Lake. With this foundation, I support building efficient, secure, and scalable data-driven solutions in the cloud.
