## Expertise in Azure Solution Architecture

As a Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect, I specialize in designing secure, scalable cloud and hybrid solutions built on Azure. My expertise spans key areas including compute, networking, storage, monitoring, and security.

I work closely with stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical architectures aligned with the Azure Well-Architected Framework and the Cloud Adoption Framework. By collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensure the successful design and implementation of robust Azure solutions that drive business value.
